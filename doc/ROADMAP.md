# TubeNotes Roadmap

It focuses on user-facing improvements, stability, and long-term maintainability rather than internal implementation details.

The roadmap is flexible and may change based on feedback and real-world usage.

## Notes

- Items in "Now" are actively being worked on or prepared.
- Items in "Next" are planned but may be split into smaller tasks.
- Items in "Later" represent ideas rather than commitments.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome via GitHub Issues.
