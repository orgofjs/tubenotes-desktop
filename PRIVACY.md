# Privacy Policy for TubeNotes

> This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

TubeNotes is a local-first application. It does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers.

**Last Updated:** February 2026

TubeNotes is designed with a **privacy-first** and **local-first** philosophy. We believe that your notes and thoughts should belong to you and stay on your machine.

## 1. Data Collection and Transmission
* **No Personal Data:** TubeNotes does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
* **No Tracking/Telemetry:** We do not use any analytics, tracking pixels, or telemetry services to monitor your usage.
* **No External Servers:** Your notes, kanban boards, and canvas data are never transmitted to external servers or third-party cloud providers.

## 2. Data Storage
* **Local Storage:** All your data is stored locally on your device using a SQLite database (managed by Prisma).
* **File Access:** The application only accesses the directories necessary for its operation and the files you explicitly interact with.

## 3. Internet Usage
TubeNotes only uses your internet connection in the following specific scenarios:
* **Update Checks:** The app may check GitHub Releases to notify you if a new version is available.
* **External Links:** If you click on an external link within your notes, it will open in your default system browser.

## 4. User Control and Data Deletion
Since all data is stored locally, you have absolute control over it. To delete all your data, simply delete the application’s local database folder located in your system's AppData directory.
